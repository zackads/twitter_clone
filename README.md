## Setup instructions

To get set up with the project:

1.  Run `git clone git@github.com:zackads/twitter_clone.git <desired sub-directory>`. The project files will be cloned to your local repo.
2.  Go to your project directory and run `npm install`. This will install `gulp` and its related packages.
3.  Run `gulp watch`. This will watch project files for changes and run the gulp tasks automatically.

Hey presto! You're ready to get cracking.
